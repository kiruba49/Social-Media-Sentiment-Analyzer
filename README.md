🗣️ Social Media Sentiment Analyzer (NLP & ML)🎯 Project OverviewThis project implements a complete Machine Learning (ML) pipeline to classify the sentiment of social media text (simulating tweets or reviews) into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories. It is an end-to-end demonstration of proficiency in Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning model deployment readiness.The system is designed to preprocess raw, unstructured text, convert it into numerical features, and train a robust classifier to predict emotional tone automatically.🛠️ Technology StackCategoryTools UsedPurposeData HandlingPandas, NumPyData loading, manipulation, and numerical operations.NLP PreprocessingNLTKTokenization, Stop Word Removal, and Lemmatization.Machine LearningScikit-learnTF-IDF Vectorization and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.SerializationpickleSaving the trained model and vectorizer for persistence.VisualizationMatplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloudModel evaluation and insightful visual reporting.⚙️ Key Steps and ConceptsThe sentiment_analyzer.py script executes the following stages:1. Data PreparationCleaning: Removal of noise (punctuation, special characters) and standardization (lowercasing).Text Normalization: Applying Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form (e.g., 'running' $\rightarrow$ 'run') for consistent feature representation.2. Feature EngineeringVectorization: Conversion of cleaned text into numerical feature vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique. This penalizes common words (like 'the') and weights important, differentiating words (like 'amazing' or 'terrible') higher.3. Model Training and PersistenceA Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the TF-IDF features.The trained model (sentiment_model.pkl) and the fitted vocabulary (tfidf_vectorizer.pkl) are saved using the pickle library, allowing the model to be loaded instantly for real-time predictions without retraining.4. Evaluation and VisualizationThe model's performance is assessed using an Accuracy Score and a detailed Classification Report.A Confusion Matrix is generated to show performance across the Positive, Negative, and Neutral classes.A Word Cloud is created to visually confirm the most frequent and influential terms driving the positive classification.🚀 How to Run the Project LocallyFollow these steps to set up and run the analysis on your machine:Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/kiruba49/Social-Media-Sentiment-Analyzer.git
cd Social-Media-Sentiment-Analyzer
Install dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the main script:Bashpython sentiment_analyzer.py
✨ Example Prediction FunctionThe saved .pkl files enable the model to make new predictions immediately:Python# Function loads the model and predicts sentiment for new text
# predict_sentiment("This product arrived broken and the support was slow.")
# Output: Negative 😠
